# Battle Of Feuds

Battle of Feuds is a game developed for a Computing Engineering's course called "Programming Introduction", in the Federal University of Pernambuco - Brazil.
To play, all players must connect to the server (MyServer.c) through the client (MyClient.c). For this, players must obtain the IP from where the server is open.

## How to Play

All players must be connected to a LAN and using the Linux operating system. To open the server you will need to use the make server command on the terminal. After this process has been carried out, it will be necessary to open the client, which will be executed with the make client command in the terminal. When opening the client, the game menu shows three options, where you can start the game, see the instructions or exit. To start the game, it is necessary to enter the IP on which the server is hosted, enter your login and choose a character. If the IP was entered incorrectly, the user will be notified and will be able to enter a new IP. When entering the correct IP, the user is automatically connected to the chat, where he must wait for everyone to connect to start the game. When all players are connected, the left-hand ctrl key must be pressed to start the game. During the game, each player has 5 lives, and your goal will be to eliminate the others and stay alive until the end.

## Compiling and runnning:

#### Compiling and runnning the server:
	$ make server
#### Compiling and runnning the client:

#### Compiling the client and the server:
	$ make
